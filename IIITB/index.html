            <h1>The mission of the Software Engineering stream at IIIT-B are two-fold:
                firstly, to educate our students to be high quality software engineers, with strong 
                hands-on experience and with strong foundations in computer science concepts; secondly,
                to contribute original and ground-breaking ideas to the state-of-the art in SE by activelyinvolving in research.
                Software engineering (SE) brings together interesting avenues of both fundamental
                and applied research contributing to the broad spectrum of activities involved in 
                the creation of large, complex, industrial strength software systems having high
                quality, dependability and within reasonable resources. Our current research 
                covers a wide variety of areas ranging from empirical to
                formal aspects of SE. Our research covers both upstream (requirement and design)
                and downstream (testing and maintenance) SDLC activities cutting across a variety
                of application domains (enterprise, embedded etc). Here is a list of some of the
                broad areas in which our faculty members are working: Pattern oriented software
                engineering, software architecture, distributed software engineering, model driven
                software engineering (MDSE), software testing, verification and validation (V&V)
                of web-services and V&V of embedded software (cyber-physical systems and adaptive systems)
                among others.
